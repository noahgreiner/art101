			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding & Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to create psuedocode for an everyday task and for a simple computer game. The pseudocode was meant to get us in the habit of thinking in pseudocode terms before jumping into code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? 
						No particular problems arose for this lab. It was really helpful to work with a lab partner with different experience.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Below are the two lists of pseudocode in javascript comments</p>
